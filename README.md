# openSTIGtool
This is an open source tool to read, modify, view, and report on STIGs from DISA. The checklist files are just XML files and the viewer is horrible. 

## Functions of this tool

Some of the things this tool will (eventually) do are listed below:

* read in checklist files
* write out checklist files
* online wizard to ask questions and mark N/A for those that don't apply by default (i.e. not a web app so no cookies)
* reporting on metrics for CAT 1, 2, 3 items and percentage of completion
* simple Dockerfile or Buildah script to create a quick image to run
* Export to EXCEL with the columns of your choice for easy viewing/emailing information
* save out a default checklist file
